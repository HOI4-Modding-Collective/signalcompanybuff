This little mod buffs the [b]Signal Company[/b], for extra immersion, realism and historical accuracy. 

I always found the signal company to be massively underwhelming and a waste of time and resources. It is the most expensive support company to build and train and takes a lot of time to research and also gives penalties to organisation, supply etc., yet it only gives a minuscule bonus to planning speed and a small increase in chance to reinforcing an ongoing battle. Other people have crunched the number and discussed how exactly the company and initiative works; [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/signal-company-and-initiative.938231/]read here[/url], be prepared to be underwhelmed.

[h1]What this mod does[/h1]
I wanted the Signal Company to be somewhat useful, so I buffed the company and its respected tech. [list=1]
[*]In addition to adding to initiative, the Signal Company also raises the recovery rate of the division it is attached to. The increase of the recovery rate is dictated by the size of the division. This generally means the larger the division, the smaller the bonus given by the Signal Company, on the other hand very small or specialised divisions benefit greatly from having a Signal Company attached to them. This coincidentally opens up a whole new avenue for specialised troops that regain their organisation fast and can rapidly reinforce ongoing battles. The bonus to initiative still applies to the Signal Company. Researching the additional technology levels further increases the recovery time bonus. The idea behind this buff is that the dedicated Signal Company speeds up the organisation of the division by helping with communication and logistics and regrouping. Having dedicated radio hardware and personnel is simply better than having to send out runners to organise the brigades and platoons. The respected tech levels symbolise improvements in radio hardware, improvements in usage and training and doctrines and so on.
[*] The tech adds a tiny amount of organization recovery for all tank types. The respected tech levels imply an improvement of the radios mounted in tanks; things like radios for individual crew members and/or an overall improvement in hardware for the long-distance communication and/or an improvement in training and doctrine.[/list]

I tried to make it balanced by using stats similar to other tech in the game. Is it actually balanced? I don't know. I did a playthrough with it and it seemed to be okay. But I might adjust the stats slightly if I feel it's too unbalanced later down the line.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
I tried everything in my power to make it compatible with other mods, patches and such, but I could only get so far. At the very least, this mod is only incompatible with other mods that edit the support technology tab and the signal company itself, but it is compatible with every other type of mod, even ones that edit the stats of other support companies. This mod is [u]not[/u] ironman compatible.
